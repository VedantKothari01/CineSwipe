# CineSwipe - Personalized Movie Discovery App

## Objective
To create an interactive mobile application that enhances movie discovery by providing personalized recommendations through a user-friendly swipe interface.

## Abstract
CineSwipe is designed to revolutionize how users discover movies and TV shows. By leveraging a swipe-based interaction, users can easily indicate their preferences, enabling the app to tailor recommendations to individual tastes. Key features include a centralized database of movie information, user accounts for personalized watchlists, and detailed movie insights through the TMDB API.

## Problem Statement
With the overwhelming number of movies and TV shows available across various platforms, users often struggle to find content that suits their tastes. This can lead to frustration and wasted time spent browsing. Addressing this issue is crucial for improving user engagement and satisfaction in the increasingly competitive entertainment landscape.

## Proposed Solution
CineSwipe addresses the discovery problem by allowing users to swipe right on movies they like and left on those they do not. This interactive feature personalizes recommendations based on user behavior, while the app provides comprehensive information about each title, including ratings, genres, and where to watch them. The inclusion of user accounts and watchlists further enhances personalization.

## Scope
The project focuses on developing a mobile application that covers the discovery of movies and TV shows. While the initial release will include core features such as swiping, detailed movie information, and user accounts, future enhancements may include social features, advanced filtering options, and integration with more streaming platforms.

## Methodology
1. **Requirement Analysis:** Gather and document all necessary features and functionalities.
2. **Design:** Create wireframes and UI designs that align with user needs and preferences.
3. **Development:** Implement the app using Java, incorporating the TMDB API and Firebase Realtime Database functionalities.
4. **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing, including unit tests and user acceptance tests, to ensure the app meets quality standards.
5. **Deployment:** Launch the app on the Android platform, followed by user feedback collection for future improvements.

## System Architecture
The application will utilize an MVVM architecture, separating concerns between the user interface, data model, and business logic. Key components will include:
- **View:** Android UI components (Activities/Fragments).
- **ViewModel:** Handles user interaction and communicates with the model.
- **Model:** Represents data, including Firebase Realtime Database and API interactions.
